      <p>I have been fortunate enough to have grown up around technology and found myself constantly learniing new skills 
      as well as spending many hours playing video games. I contribute my curiosity for computer science to my upbringing. </p>

      <h2>Things I've learned:</h2>
        

  <ul>
  <li>I learnt the 'Agile' process that Platform 45 follows to design products for clients. </li>
  <li>I learnt about the design process of bringing a product to life. </li>
  <li>I also learnt about the benefit of having designated rooms to conduct meetings. </li>
  </ul>
